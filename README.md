# nomic-game
A game of [Nomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic), implemented in Node.js to be played on Github. To be used with nomic-bot.

## What is Nomic?
In short:

> Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game.
> The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it.
> Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.
> â€”Peter Suber, The Paradox of Self-Amendment

This implementation of Nomic is to be played on Github.
Changes to the rules are submitted as Pull Requests (PRs), and voted in the comments on Github.
A bot then tallies the votes and merges the changes accordingly.

This repo represents a starting game, with a basic set of rules.


## Initial Rules
